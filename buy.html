                <p><b>Price - $200,000</b></p>
                <p>This is the perfect house to settle down in! With the expansive backyard, it makes it the perfect place for children to play. It is also is perfect for those
                    gardeners out there. If you think this is the perfect place for you, contact one of our agents.

                    <p><b>Price - $100,000</b></p>
                    <p>This house looks almost fake with how perfect it is! With a backyard that seems near infinitely expansive. The house does not have as many bedrooms as the Sweet Apple, but it's still perfect
                        for families. If you think this is the perfect place for you, contact one of our agents.

                    <p>We have to legally disclosed that this house is haunted by the owner's previous wife, but it still makes a great home, and with quirks like that, what is not to love?</p>
